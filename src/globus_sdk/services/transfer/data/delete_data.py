class DeleteData(GlobusPayload):
    r"""
    Convenience class for constructing a delete document, to use as the
    `data` parameter to
    :meth:`submit_delete <globus_sdk.TransferClient.submit_delete>`.

    At least one item must be added using
    :meth:`add_item <globus_sdk.DeleteData.add_item>`.

    :param endpoint: The endpoint ID which is targeted by this deletion Task
    :param label: A string label for the Task
    :param submission_id: A submission ID value fetched via :meth:`get_submission_id
        <globus_sdk.TransferClient.get_submission_id>`. By default, the SDK
        will fetch and populate this field when :meth:`submit_delete
        <globus_sdk.TransferClient.submit_delete>` is called.
    :param recursive: Recursively delete subdirectories on the target endpoint
      [default: ``False``]
    :param ignore_missing: Ignore nonexistent files and directories instead of treating
        them as errors. [default: ``False``]
    :param interpret_globs: Enable expansion of ``\*?[]`` characters in the last
        component of paths, unless they are escaped with a preceding backslash, ``\\``
        [default: ``False``]
    :param deadline: An ISO-8601 timestamp (as a string) or a datetime object which
        defines a deadline for the deletion. At the deadline, even if the data deletion
        is not complete, the job will be canceled. We recommend ensuring that the
        timestamp is in UTC to avoid confusion and ambiguity. Examples of ISO-8601
        timestamps include ``2017-10-12 09:30Z``, ``2017-10-12 12:33:54+00:00``, and
        ``2017-10-12``
    :param skip_activation_check: When true, allow submission even if the endpoint
        isn't currently activated
    :param notify_on_succeeded: Send a notification email when the delete task
        completes with a status of SUCCEEDED.
        [default: ``True``]
    :param notify_on_failed: Send a notification email when the delete task completes
        with a status of FAILED.
        [default: ``True``]
    :param notify_on_inactive: Send a notification email when the delete task changes
        status to INACTIVE. e.g. From credentials expiring.
        [default: ``True``]
    :param local_user: Optional value passed to identity mapping specifying which local
        user account to map to. Only usable with Globus Connect Server v5 mapped
        collections.
    :param additional_fields: additional fields to be added to the delete
        document. Mostly intended for internal use

    **Examples**

    See the :meth:`submit_delete <globus_sdk.TransferClient.submit_delete>`
    documentation for example usage.
