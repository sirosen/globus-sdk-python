    A scope object is a representation of a scope and its dynamic dependencies

    A scope may be optional (also referred to as "atomically revocable").
    An optional scope can be revoked without revoking consent for other scopes
    which were granted at the same time.

    Scopes are immutable, and provide several evolver methods which produce new
    Scopes. In particular, ``with_dependency`` and ``with_dependencies`` create
    new scopes with added dependencies.

    ``str(Scope(...))`` produces a valid scope string for use in various methods.
