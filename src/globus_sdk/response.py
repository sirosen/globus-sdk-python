    Response object that wraps an HTTP response from the underlying HTTP
    library. If the response is JSON, the parsed data will be available in

    The most common response data is a JSON dictionary. To make
    handling this type of response as seemless as possible, the
    ``GlobusHTTPResponse`` object implements the immutable mapping protocol for
    dict-style access. This is just an alias for access to the underlying data.

    If ``data`` is not a dictionary, item access will raise ``TypeError``.
