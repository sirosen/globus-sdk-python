class BaseClient:
    r"""
    Abstract base class for clients with error handling for Globus APIs.

    :param app: A ``GlobusApp`` which will be used for handling authorization and
        storing and validating tokens. Passing an ``app`` will automatically include
        a client's default scopes in the ``app``'s scope requirements unless specific
        ``app_scopes`` are given. If ``app_name`` is not given, the ``app``'s
        ``app_name`` will be used. Mutually exclusive with ``authorizer``.
    :param app_scopes: Optional list of ``Scope`` objects to be added to ``app``'s
        scope requirements instead of ``default_scope_requirements``. Requires ``app``.
    :param authorizer: A ``GlobusAuthorizer`` which will generate Authorization headers.
        Mutually exclusive with ``app``.
    :param app_name: Optional "nice name" for the application. Has no bearing on the
        semantics of client actions. It is just passed as part of the User-Agent
        string, and may be useful when debugging issues with the Globus Team.
        If both``app`` and ``app_name`` are given, this value takes priority.
    :param base_url: The URL for the service. Most client types initialize this value
        intelligently by default. Set it when inheriting from BaseClient or
        communicating through a proxy. This value takes precedence over the class
        attribute of the same name.
    :param transport_params: Options to pass to the transport for this client

    All other parameters are for internal use and should be ignored.
