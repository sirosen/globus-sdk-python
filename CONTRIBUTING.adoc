Contributing to the Globus SDK
==============================

First off, thank you so much for taking the time to contribute! :+1:

If you want to do local development, you can setup a development virtualenv in
`.venv` by running `make localdev`.

Reporting Bugs & Requesting Features
------------------------------------

  - Check if there's a matching
      https://github.com/globus/globus-sdk-python/issues[issue]
      before opening a new issue or pull request
  - When possible, provide a code sample to reproduce bugs

Linting & Testing
-----------------

Testing the SDK requires https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[tox].

Once you have `tox` installed, you can run testing or linting on the repo
with `tox` or `tox -e lint`. These are wrapped for convenience as `make test`
and `make lint` as well.

All code must pass `make lint test`, which runs linting and tests.

Optional, but recommended linting setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the best development experience, we recommend setting up linting and
autofixing integrations with your editor and git. These settings are optional,
but strongly recommended.

Install pre-commit hooks
++++++++++++++++++++++++

This automatically formats and lints your staged changes when you commit.

You must install https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit] in order to use these
hooks. Once you have the tool, just run

    $ pre-commit install

NOTE: If you need to bypass pre-commit hooks, you can commit with `--no-verify`

Integrate Linters & Fixers with your Editor
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

All code is autoformatted with https://github.com/ambv/black[black] and
https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort[isort], and checked with
https://flake8.pycqa.org/[flake8].

Many editors, including vim, emacs, Atom, and VS Code have plugins or
extensions that allow them to automatically run `black` and `isort` whenever a
file is saved, and show errors flagged by `flake8` in a separate pane, buffer,
or sidebar.

Configuring such editor integrations will save you time and energy, as your
work will usually pass linting before you even run `make lint` or commit your
changes.

Expectations for Pull Requests
------------------------------

  - *Make sure it merges cleanly*. We may request that you rebase if your PR
      has merge conflicts.
  - *List any issues closed by the pull request*
  - *Squash intermediate and fixup commits*. We recommend running
    `git rebase --interactive` prior to submitting a pull request.
  - Add new work to the "Unreleased" section of the changelog

These are our guidelines for good commit messages:

  - No lines over 72 characters
  - No GitHub emoji -- use your words
  - Reference issues and pull requests where appropriate
  - Present tense and imperative mood

Additional Recommendations
--------------------------

  - Try to use raw strings for docstrings -- ensures that ReST won't be
      confused by characters like `\\`
  - Use examples very liberally in documentation
  - Show where you imported from within the SDK. Start at least one example with
      `from globus_sdk.modulename import ClassName` on a page with docs for
      `ClassName`
  - Think very hard before adding a new dependency -- keep the dependencies of
      `globus_sdk` as lightweight as possible
