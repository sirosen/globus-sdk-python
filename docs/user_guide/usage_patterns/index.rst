Usage Patterns
==============

Globus offers a wide variety of services and functionality to assist research
science.
Additionally, ``globus_sdk`` itself offers high level abstractions over these
capabilities.
Tying together the various components into a working application is therefore
often complex, and this section of the documentation provides specific
scenarios or patterns of use which are reusable across projects.

Reference documentation is indexed by specific component, and therefore
separated into pages and sections by each subservice.
By contrast, the Usage Pattern documentation is organized by how a user is
trying to leverage Globus for their needs.


Data Transfer
-------------

These documents cover various ways of setting up and coordinating data
transfers.
