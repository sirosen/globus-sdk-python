Responses
=========

All method return values for Globus SDK Clients are ``GlobusResponse``
objects.
Some ``GlobusResponse`` objects are iterables.
In those cases, their contents will also be ``GlobusResponse`` objects.

To customize client methods with additional detail, the SDK uses subclasses of
``GlobusResponse``.
For example the ``GlobusHTTPResponse`` attaches HTTP response information.
