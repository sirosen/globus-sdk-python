Globus Auth
===========

There are several types of client object for communicating with the Globus Auth
service. A client object may represent your application (as the driver of
authentication and authorization flows), in which case the
``NativeAppAuthClient`` or ``ConfidentialAppAuthClient`` classes should
generally be used.

.. autoclass:: globus_sdk.AuthClient
   :members:
   :member-order: bysource
   :show-inheritance:
   :exclude-members: error_class

.. autoclass:: globus_sdk.NativeAppAuthClient
   :members:
   :member-order: bysource
   :show-inheritance:
   :exclude-members: error_class

.. autoclass:: globus_sdk.ConfidentialAppAuthClient
   :members:
   :member-order: bysource
   :show-inheritance:
   :exclude-members: error_class

Helper Objects
--------------

The ``IdentityMap`` is a specialized object which aids in the particular
use-case in which the Globus Auth ``get_identities`` API is being used to
resolve large numbers of usernames or IDs. It combines caching, request
batching, and other functionality.

..
    We set special-members so that __getitem__ and __delitem__ are included.
    But then we need to exclude specific members because we don't want people
    reading about __weakref__ in our docs.
.. autoclass:: globus_sdk.IdentityMap
   :members:
   :special-members:
   :exclude-members: __dict__,__weakref__
   :show-inheritance:

Auth Responses
--------------

.. autoclass:: globus_sdk.auth.token_response.OAuthDependentTokenResponse
   :members:

OAuth2 Flow Managers
--------------------

These objects represent in-progress OAuth2 authentication flows.
Most typically, you should not use these objects, but rather rely on the
:class:`globus_sdk.AuthClient` object to manage one of these for you through
its ``oauth2_*`` methods.

All Flow Managers inherit from the
:class:`GlobusOAuthFlowManager \
<globus_sdk.auth.oauth_flow_manager.GlobusOAuthFlowManager>` abstract class.
They are a combination of a store for OAuth2 parameters specific to the
authentication method you are using and methods which act upon those parameters.

.. autoclass:: globus_sdk.auth.GlobusNativeAppFlowManager
   :members:
   :show-inheritance:

.. autoclass:: globus_sdk.auth.GlobusAuthorizationCodeFlowManager
   :members:
   :show-inheritance:
