CHANGELOG
=========

.. _changelog_version3:

See :ref:`versioning` for our versioning policy.

The :ref:`upgrading <upgrading>` doc is a good reference if you are upgrading
to a major new version of the SDK.

.. scriv-insert-here

v3.7.0 (2022-04-08)
-------------------

* Add a client for the Timer service (:pr:`548`)

  * Add ``TimerClient`` class, along with ``TimerJob`` for constructing data
    to pass to the Timer service for job creation, and ``TimerAPIError``
  * Modify ``globus_sdk.config`` utilities to provide URLs for Actions and
    Timer services

* Fix annotations to allow request data to be a string. This is
  supported at runtime but was missing from annotations. (:pr:`549`)

v3.6.0 (2022-03-18)
-------------------

* ``ScopeBuilder`` objects now support ``known_url_scopes``, and known scope
  arguments to a ``ScopeBuilder`` may now be of type ``str`` in addition to
  ``list[str]`` (:pr:`536`)

* Add the ``RequestsTransport.tune`` contextmanager to the transport layer,
  allowing the settings on the transport to be set temporarily (:pr:`540`)

v3.5.0 (2022-03-02)
-------------------

* ``globus_sdk.IdentityMap`` can now take a cache as an input. This allows
  multiple ``IdentityMap`` instances to share the same storage cache. Any
  mutable mapping type is valid, so the cache can be backed by a database or
  other storage (:pr:`500`)

* Add ``TransferRequestsTransport`` class that does not retry ExternalErrors.
  This fixes cases in which the ``TransferClient`` incorrectly retried requests (:pr:`522`)

* Use the "reason phrase" as a failover for stringified API errors with no body (:pr:`524`)

* Add support for ``include`` as a parameter to ``GroupsClient.get_group``.
  ``include`` can be a string or iterable of strings (:pr:`528`)

* Enhance documentation for all of the parameters on methods of ``GroupsClient``

* Add a new method to tokenstorage, ``SQLiteAdapter.iter_namespaces``, which
  iterates over all namespaces visible in the token database (:pr:`529`)

v3.4.2 (2022-02-18)
-------------------

* Fix the pagination behavior for ``TransferClient`` on ``task_skipped_errors`` and
  ``task_successful_transfers``, and apply the same fix to the endpoint manager
  variants of these methods. Prior to the fix, paginated calls would return a
  single page of results and then stop (:pr:`520`)

v3.4.1 (2022-02-11)
-------------------

* The ``typing_extensions`` requirement in package metadata now sets a lower
  bound of ``4.0``, to force upgrades of installations to get a new enough version
  (:pr:`518`)

v3.4.0 (2022-02-11)
-------------------

* Support pagination on ``SearchClient.post_search`` (:pr:`507`)

* Add support for scroll queries to ``SearchClient``. ``SearchClient.scroll``
  and ``SearchClient.paginated.scroll`` are now available as methods, and a new
  helper class, ``SearchScrollQuery``, can be used to easily construct
  scrolling queries. (:pr:`507`)

* Add methods to ``SearchClient`` for managing index roles. ``create_role``,
  ``delete_role``, and ``get_role_list`` (:pr:`507`)

* Add ``mapped_collection`` and ``filter`` query arguments to ``GCSClient.get_collection_list`` (:pr:`510`)

* Add role methods to ``GCSClient`` (:pr:`513`)

  * ``GCSClient.get_role_list`` lists endpoint or collection roles
  * ``GCSClient.create_role`` creates a role
  * ``GCSClient.get_role`` gets a single role
  * ``GCSClient.delete_role`` deletes a role

* The response from ``AuthClient.get_identities`` now supports iteration,
  returning results from the ``"identities"`` array (:pr:`514`)

v3.3.1 (2022-01-25)
-------------------

* Packaging bugfix. ``globus-sdk`` is now built with pypa's ``build`` tool, to
  resolve issues with wheel builds.

v3.3.0 (2022-01-25)
-------------------

* Add ``update_group`` method to ``GroupsClient`` (:pr:`506`)

* The ``TransferData`` and ``DeleteData`` helper objects now accept the
  following parameters: ``notify_on_succeeded``, ``notify_on_failed``, and
  ``notify_on_inactive``. All three are boolean parameters with a default
  of ``True``. (:pr:`502`)

* Several minor bugs have been found and fixed (:pr:`504`)

  * Exceptions raised in the SDK always use ``raise ... from`` syntax where
    appropriate. This corrects exception chaining in the local endpoint and
    several response objects.

  * The encoding of files opened by the SDK is now always ``UTF-8``

  * ``TransferData`` will now reject unsupported ``sync_level`` values with a
    ``ValueError`` on initialization, rather than erroring at submission time.
    The ``sync_level`` has also had its type annotation fixed to allow for
    ``int`` values.

  * Several instances of undocumented parameters have been discovered, and these
    are now rectified.

* Add ``Paginator.wrap`` as a method for getting a paginated methods. This interface is more
  verbose than the existing ``paginated`` methods, but correctly preserves type
  annotations. It is therefore preferable for users who are using ``mypy`` to do
  type checking. (:pr:`494`)

* ``Paginator`` objects are now generics over a type var for their page type. The
  page type is bounded by ``GlobusHTTPResponse``, and most type-checker behaviors
  will remain unchanged (:pr:`495`)

* Document ``globus_sdk.config.get_service_url`` and ``globus_sdk.config.get_webapp_url``
  (:pr:`496`)

  * Internally, these are updated to be able to default to the ``GLOBUS_SDK_ENVIRONMENT`` setting,
    so specifying an environment is no longer required

v3.2.1 (2021-12-13)
-------------------

* Update to avoid deprecation warnings on python 3.10 (:pr:`499`)

v3.2.0 (2021-12-02)
-------------------

* Add ``iter_items`` as a method on ``TransferData`` and ``DeleteData`` (:pr:`488`)

* Add the `resource_server` property to client classes and objects. For example,
  `TransferClient.resource_server` and `GroupsClient().resource_server` are now usable
  to get the resource server string for the relevant services. `resource_server` is
  documented as part of `globus_sdk.BaseClient` and may be `None`. (:pr:`489`)

* Fix type annotations on client methods with paginated variants (:pr:`491`)

* ClientCredentialsAuthorizer now accepts ``Union[str, Iterable[str]]``
  as the type for scopes (:pr:`498`)

* The implementation of several properties of ``GlobusHTTPResponse`` has
  changed (:pr:`497`)

  * Responses have a new property, ``headers``, a case-insensitive
    dict of headers from the response

  * Responses now implement ``http_status`` and ``content_type`` as
    properties without setters

v3.1.0 (2021-10-13)
-------------------

* Add ``filter`` as a supported parameter to ``TransferClient.task_list`` (:pr:`484`)
* The ``filter`` parameter to ``TransferClient.task_list`` and
  ``TransferClient.operation_ls`` can now be passed as a ``Dict[str, str | List[str]]``.
  Documentation on the ``TransferClient`` explains how this will be formatted,
  and is linked from the param docs for ``filter`` on each method (:pr:`484`)
* Adjust package metadata for `cryptography` dependency, specifying
  `cryptography>=3.3.1` and no upper bound. This is meant to help mitigate
  issues in which an older `cryptography` version is installed gets used in
  spite of it being incompatible with `pyjwt[crypto]>=2.0` (:pr:`486`)

v3.0.3 (2021-10-11)
-------------------

* Fix several internal decorators which were destroying type information about
  decorated functions. Type signatures of many methods are therefore corrected (:pr:`485`)

v3.0.2 (2021-09-29)
-------------------

* Update the minimum dependency versions to lower bounds which are verified to
  work with the testsuite (:pr:`482`)
* Produce more debug logging when SDK logs are enabled (:pr:`480`)

v3.0.1 (2021-09-15)
-------------------

* ``ScopeBuilder`` objects now define the type of ``__getattr__`` for ``mypy`` to
  know that dynamic attributes are strings (:pr:`472`)
* Fix remaining ``type: ignore`` usages in globus-sdk (:pr:`473`)
* Fix malformed PEP508 ``python_version`` bound in dev dependencies (:pr:`474`)

v3.0.0 (2021-09-14)
-------------------

* Add ``filter_is_error`` parameter to advanced task list (:pr:`467`)
* Add a ``LocalGlobusConnectPersonal.get_owner_info()`` for looking up local
  user information from gridmap (:pr:`466`)
* Add support for GCS collection create and update. This includes new data
  helpers, ``MappedCollectionDcoument`` and ``GuestCollectionDocument`` (:pr:`468`)
* Remove support for ``bytes`` values for fields consuming UUIDs (:pr:`471`)
* Add support for specifying ``config_dir`` to ``LocalGlobusConnectPersonal`` (:pr:`470`)

v3.0.0b4 (2021-09-01)
---------------------

* Minor fix to wheel builds: do not declare wheels as universal (:pr:`444`)
* Add a new ``GCSClient`` class for interacting with GCS Manager APIs
  (:pr:`447`)
* Rename ``GCSScopeBuilder`` to ``GCSCollectionScopeBuilder`` and add
  ``GCSEndpointScopeBuilder``. The ``GCSClient`` includes helpers for
  instantiating these scope builders (:pr:`448`)
* ``GCSClient`` supports ``get_collection`` and ``delete_collection``.
  ``get_collection`` uses a new ``UnpackingGCSResponse`` response type (:pr:`451`,
  :pr:`464`)
* Remove ``BaseClient.qjoin_path`` (:pr:`452`)
* The ``additional_params`` parameter to ``AuthClient.oauth2_get_authorize_url``
  has been renamed to ``query_params`` for consistency with other methods (:pr:`453`)
* Enforce keyword-only arguments for most SDK-provied APIs (:pr:`453`)
* Fix annotations for ``server_id`` on ``TransferClient`` methods (:pr:`455`)
* Add ``delete_destination_extra`` param to ``TransferData`` (:pr:`456`)
* Ensure all ``TransferClient`` method parameters are documented (:pr:`449`,
  :pr:`454`, :pr:`457`, :pr:`458`, :pr:`459`, :pr:`461`, :pr:`462`)
* ``TransferClient.endpoint_manager_task_list`` now takes filters as named
  keyword arguments, not only in ``query_params`` (:pr:`460`)
* Fix ``visibility`` typo in ``GroupsClient`` (:pr:`463`)
* All type annotations for ``Sequence`` which could be relaxed to ``Iterable``
  have been updated (:pr:`465`)

v3.0.0b3 (2021-08-13)
---------------------

* Flesh out the ``GroupsClient`` and add helpers for interacting with the
  Globus Groups service, including enumerated constants, payload builders, and
  a high-level client for doing non-batch operations called the
  ``GroupsManager`` (:pr:`435`, :pr:`443`)
* globus-sdk now provides much more complete type annotations coverage,
  allowing type checkers like ``mypy`` to catch a much wider range of usage
  errors (:pr:`442`)

v3.0.0b2 (2021-07-16)
---------------------

* Add scope constants and scope construction helpers. See new documentation on
  :ref:`scopes and ScopeBuilders <scopes>` for details (:pr:`437`, :pr:`440`)
* Improve the rendering of API exceptions in stack traces to include the
  method, URI, and authorization scheme (if recognized) (:pr:`439`)
* Payload helper objects (``TransferData``, ``DeleteData``, and ``SearchQuery``)
  now inherit from a custom object, not ``dict``, but they are still dict-like in
  behavior (:pr:`438`)
* API Errors now have an attached ``info`` object with parsed error data where
  applicable. See the :ref:`ErrorInfo documentation <error_info>` for details
  (:pr:`441`)

v3.0.0b1 (2021-07-02)
---------------------

* Add support for ``TransferClient.get_shared_endpoint_list`` (:pr:`434`)
* Passthrough parameters to SDK methods for query params and body params are no
  longer accepted as extra keyword arguments. Instead, they must be passed
  explicitly in a ``query_params``, ``body_params``, or ``additional_fields``
  dictionary, depending on the context (:pr:`433`)
* The interface for retry parameters has been simplified. ``RetryPolicy``
  objects have been merged into the transport object, and retry parameters like
  ``max_retries`` may now be supplied directly as ``transport_params``
  (:pr:`430`)

v3.0.0a4 (2021-06-28)
---------------------

* Fix several paginators which were broken in ``3.0.0a3`` (:pr:`431`)
* Add ``BaseClient`` to the top-level exports of ``globus_sdk``, so it can now
  be accessed under the name ``globus_sdk.BaseClient``
* Autodocumentation of paginated methods (:pr:`432`)

v3.0.0a3 (2021-06-25)
---------------------

* Pagination has changed significantly. (:pr:`418`)

** Methods which support pagination like ``TransferClient.endpoint_search`` no
   longer return an iterable ``PaginatedResource`` type. Instead, these client
   methods return ``GlobusHTTPResponse`` objects with a single page of results.

** Paginated variants of these methods are available by renaming a call from
   ``client.<method>`` to ``client.paginated.<method>``. So, for example, a
   ``TransferClient`` now supports ``client.paginated.endpoint_search()``.
   The arguments to this function are the same as the original method.

** ``client.paginated.<method>`` calls return ``Paginator`` objects, which
   support two types of iteration: by ``pages()`` and by ``items()``. To
   replicate the same behavior as SDK v1.x and v2.x ``PaginatedResource``
   types, use ``items()``, as in
   ``client.paginated.endpoint_search("query").items()``

v3.0.0a2 (2021-06-10)
---------------------

* Refactor response classes (:pr:`425`)
* A new subpackage is available for public use,
  ``globus_sdk.tokenstorage`` (:pr:`405`)
* Add client for Globus Groups API, ``globus_sdk.GroupsClient``. Includes a
  dedicated error class, ``globus_sdk.GroupsAPIError``

v3.0.0a1 (2021-06-04)
---------------------

* Update documentation site style and layout (:pr:`423`)
* The interface for ``GlobusAuthorizer`` now defines
  ``get_authorization_header`` instead of ``set_authorization_header``, and
  additional keyword arguments are not allowed (:pr:`422`)
* New Transport layer handles HTTP details, variable payload
  encodings, and automatic request retries (:pr:`417`)
* Instead of ``json_body=...`` and ``text_body=...``, use ``data=...``
  combined with ``encoding="json"``, ``encoding="form"``, or
  ``encoding="text"`` to format payload data. ``encoding="json"`` is the
  default when ``data`` is a dict.
* By default, requests are retried automatically on potentially transient
  error codes (e.g. ``http_status=500``) and network errors with exponential
  backoff
* ``globus_sdk.BaseClient`` and its subclasses define ``retry_policy``
  and ``transport_class`` class attributes which can be used to customize the
  retry behavior used
* ``globus-sdk`` now provides PEP561 typing data (:pr:`420`)
* The JWT dependency has been updated to ``pyjwt>=2,<3`` (:pr:`416`)
* The config files in ``~/.globus.cfg`` and ``/etc/globus.cfg`` are no longer
  used. Configuration can now be done via environment variables (:pr:`409`)
* ``BaseClient.app_name`` is a property with a custom setter, replacing
  ``set_app_name`` (:pr:`415`)
* ``OAuthTokenResponse.decode_id_token`` can now be provided a JWK and openid
  configuration as parameters. ``AuthClient`` implements methods for fetching
  these data, so that they can be fetched and stored outside of this call.
  There is no automatic caching of these data. (:pr:`403`)
* Remove ``allowed_authorizer_types`` restriction from ``BaseClient`` (:pr:`407`)
* Remove ``auth_client=...`` parameter to
  ``OAuthTokenResponse.decode_id_token`` (:pr:`400`)
