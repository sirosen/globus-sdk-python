Globus SDK for Python
=====================

This SDK provides a convenient Pythonic interface to
`Globus <https://www.globus.org>`_ REST APIs,
including the Transfer API and the Globus Auth API. Documentation
for the REST APIs is available at https://docs.globus.org.

Two interfaces are provided - a low level interface, supporting only
``GET``, ``PUT``, ``POST``, and ``DELETE`` operations, and a high level
interface providing helper methods for common API resources.

Source code is available at https://github.com/globus/globus-sdk-python.
